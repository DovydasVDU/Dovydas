# Hello everyone, I am 19 years old and hoping to be a programmer. My hobbies are cars, track and field athletics and computers.
# My interest in programmers emerged in pandemics, when I was doing programming while being in my history classes :)
# Will try to do the best as I can in this field and hope for the best!
